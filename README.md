# Signature Recognition Python Project

## Introduction
This Python project aims to develop a signature recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system will be capable of identifying and verifying signatures from input images.

## Features
- Signature detection: Identify signatures within images.
- Signature verification: Verify the authenticity of signatures against a known database.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: 
  - OpenCV
  - TensorFlow
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - PyQt5 (for GUI)
- Pre-trained model (optional, if using transfer learning)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/signature-recognition.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the instructions provided in the GUI for signature recognition and verification.

## Training (Optional)
If you want to train the model on custom data:
1. Prepare your dataset and organize it properly.
2. Modify the training script (`train.py`) according to your dataset and model architecture.
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
